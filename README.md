# Probabilistic Precision and Recall Towards Reliable Evaluation of Generative Models (ICCV 2023)
The official implementation of **Probabilistic Precision and Recall Towards Reliable Evaluation of Generative Models** (P-precision & P-recall), accepted at ICCV-2023.
P-precision and P-recall aims to provide reliable estimates for evaluating fidelity and diversity of generative models even with the presence of out-of-distribution samples, based on our novel probabilistic approach.
The paper will be cited shortly.
